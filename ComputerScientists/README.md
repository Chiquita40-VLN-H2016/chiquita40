## Program which lists known characters from Computer Science

I. Description how the program works
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have developed a program that holds a list over Computer Scientists.

* You can add a new Computer Scientist to the list. 
* You can print out a list of Computer Scientists on screen ordered by name, birth year, death year and gender.
* You can search for a name of a Computer Scientist.
* You can edit an entry of a Computer Scientist.

You can do these commands as often as you whish or until you type in 'quit'.
